# Introduction to RaBitQ

## Latest Updates

- [2026.03.30]: The RaBitQ optimization patches were released on the Gitcode platform, implementing both equivalence and non-equivalence index optimizations.

## Project Introduction

RaBitQ is a randomized binary quantization method (SIGMOD 2024) proposed by the NTU team for high-dimensional vector approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search. It quantizes a D-dimensional vector into a D-bit binary string and provides a theoretical error bound. The original implementation relies on the x86_64 AVX2 instruction set. Kunpeng optimizations are based on deep, architecture-specific intrusive modifications to the open-source RaBitQ codebase. This extends its support to the AArch64 architecture, introducing performance optimizations and functional enhancements. These include FP16 precision optimization, NEON SIMD vectorization, assembly-level Lookup Table (LUT) acceleration, Spilling with Orthogonality-Amplified Residuals (SOAR) spilled vector assignment, and ML-based adaptive nprobe.
